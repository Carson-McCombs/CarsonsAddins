If there you are running into issues, a suggestion might be to create a dedicated line style called something like 'Dimension Lines' to make it consistent between families. Another thing to note is that for elements such as Pipes, that are completely generated by Revit, you will need to add their centerline or default line styles ( in this case, make sure Pipes is added to the list )."/>

If it is the last element in a line or it is adjacent to a non-linear element, such as a tee or bend, then that side will act as an exact dimension. Otherwise, it will act as a Negate dimension mode. In other words, good for fittings like HDSS where each individual pipe length is not as important as the total pipe length it makes up."/>
