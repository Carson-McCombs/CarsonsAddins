![Select Pipe Line](https://github.com/Carson-McCombs/RevitTools/assets/130939367/28848fa8-09a6-4e93-9c48-3387d19c7800)

***Measure the total length of selected pipe***

![Total Pipe Length](https://github.com/Carson-McCombs/RevitTools/assets/130939367/c4853da2-6940-4477-a0d8-b9b185f22c1f)

***Dimension Pipe Line Tool***

-Allows for Piping Elements ( Pipes, Pipe Fittings, and Pipe Accessories ) within a "Pipeline" ( as defined above ) to be dimensions together ( without gaskets / flanges / unions ) in one click. Note: Pipe Accessories and Pipe Fittings both require Reference Lines with the subcategory of "Center line" or "zLines" from the center of each Connector to the center of the element to function correctly.

***Smart Flip***

**Issue:** Not being able to flip a flange without breaking connections and occasionally moving elements.

![Issue with Flipping Flange](https://github.com/Carson-McCombs/RevitTools/assets/130939367/ea94fff4-fd34-4d98-bc9d-c2a573d0d5fd)

**Fix:** Smart Flip which disconnects the elements, flips the flange, then reconnects the elements in one click

![Smart Flip](https://github.com/Carson-McCombs/RevitTools/assets/130939367/e886694a-0e40-4f93-9e51-52ecf9c03f5a)

***Quick Dimension Tool:***

**Issue:** To replace a single dimensions text with a question mark takes you double clicking the dimension, clicking the option to replace the text, then typing in your question mark, and pressing "Apply". -> takes about 5 actions, which is fine unless you need to do multiple.

![Issue with Question mark Dimension](https://github.com/Carson-McCombs/RevitTools/assets/130939367/7e0b6359-6991-45e5-9dab-00b6b714177f)

**Fix:** takes only one click to replace each dimension with a whatever text you would like.
