Revit Issue of not being able to flip a flange without breaking connections

Fix: Smart Flip which disconnects the elements, flips the flange, then reconnects the elements in one click

To replace a single dimensions text with a question mark takes you double clicking the dimension, clicking the option to replace the text, then typing in your question mark, and pressing "Apply". -> takes about 5 actions, which is fine unless you need to do multiple.

Fix: takes only one click to replace each dimension with a whatever text you would like.
